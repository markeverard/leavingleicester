        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>I've seen sunshineeeeeee</h1><p><small>Entry added on 08/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Yes, you read that correctly. The sun has got his hat on and is peeking out from behind the clouds. Its just a shame that this is the last day of our Sydney adventure. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I've added some photos from the last three days, as Bart described in her last post. First up is the ferry ride and walk around Manly beach.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Next up is pictures from the evening where we went bat hunting in the Botanical gardens. Bats are great, especially when playing cricket.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Finally there are photos from our day trip to the Blue mountains, plenty of shots of kangeroos and my new favorite marsupial, a wombat (which I have renamed a pouched badger)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;You can clearly see that the Blue Mountains were more grey than blue, still the clouds did part to allow one or two nice shots. We had a quick stop at a winery on the way back where Bart managed to get drunk on 5 very small samples of wine.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=67811&l=47ba5&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=67811&l=47ba5&id=700485318</a>
