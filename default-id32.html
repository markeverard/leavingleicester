        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>The sound of silence</h1><p><small>Entry added on 22/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Fact of the day: New Zealand is nicknamed the Godzone. Why? Because its 'God's own' country, if the creator were to make himself a place then this would surely be it. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We had a long drive to reach Milford Sound but it was most definitely worth it. Situated in the heart of Fiordland (for some reason the NZ's spell Fjord with an i) it is probably one of the most beautiful places I've laid eyes on, hopefully the photos will show you that, although trust me they don't do it justice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We were actually extremely lucky to have the bright sunshine, as Milford has an average of 6 metres of rainfall a year. This meant we had some fantastic views of the steep fiord slopes and mountain tops along with the crisp clear sea water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We set out on a 2 hour boat cruise which took us all around the fiord, out to the Tasman sea and then back again stopping off to see the vast array of marine and wildlife, such as seals and penguins. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We also pulled right underneath one of the many waterfalls. Showering in a waterfall isn't nearly as nice as the movies make out, however it is amazing fun purely because of all of the rainbows that the fine spray creates. I love rainbows me. Bungle was my favourite. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Theres so much I could tell you about this place, but I'm not going to. Instead you'll have to ply my hand with a pint when I'm back and listen as I regurgitate the thousands of facts and thoughts I have in my head about this place.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If only English football were this beautiful.</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=71278&l=75b9e&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=71278&l=75b9e&id=700485318</a>
