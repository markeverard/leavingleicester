        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>You Can't Beat Wellington.......</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Wayne and Ned kindly offered to pick us up from Wellington airport at 730am on a Saturday morning and Wayne certainly looked like he'd enjoyed his Friday night.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We got back to Casa del Waynedda at about 830am and promptly cracked open some breakfast beers, fired up the BBQ and were cooked a fry up, on the condition that my beard was dismantled. After the fuzz had gone we sat down to watch England - Croatia game that Wayne had recorded. This necessitated some more beer and so the tone of the day was set.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the afternoon we drove out to Eastbourne to grab a quick beer before coming back home for some more beer before going out to a comedy night at a local bar highlighting the best of local Wellington comedy talent. The night ended somehow.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The next day was relaxed, with a trip to climb up to a lookout over Wellington, followed by a quick trip back down and a beer or two to rehydrate.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Mmmm beer.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72957&l=32d48&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72957&l=32d48&id=700485318</a>
