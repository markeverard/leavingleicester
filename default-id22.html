        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Great Ocean Road</h1><p><small>Entry added on 14/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>We hired a car for a couple of days and headed out along the great ocean road!! We stopped at split point lighthouse and then drove on through to Lorne.  The drive was beautiful...better than I was expecting really. Lots of nice curving roads beside white sandy beaches and bright blue ocean. We also managed to fluke some amazing weather...lots & lots of sun and not a cloud in the sky...this is more like it! We stopped for a drink by a creek at Lorne and then drove through Apollo Bay until we got to the 12 apostles. Quite a drive for one day (well, it was absolutely fine for me as I was looking out the window while eV motored us along).  Good to see the Apostles but we didn't stay long before heading back to Apollo Bay to look for our hotel.  I managed to book us into a swanky deluxe cabin...very nice indeed...log fire and jacuzzi bath and the cabin itself was set into the mountain with views of the forest and ocean...quite a change from Singapore ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After a lovely breakfast the next day we drove back to Melbourne and saw some cool Ozzie wildlife....an echidna crossing the road just in front of us and then eV managed to spot a koala bear up a tree! So we pulled over to take piccies of the little fella but he was mostly busy sleeping and didn't want to pose too much :) We also passed a sign for Carisbrooke Creek :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;When back in Melbourne we met up with fellow Leicester people Ade and James Gray for a few (ahem!) drinks.. a very fun evening :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;That was it.....Australia over...next stop New Zealand!<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69379&l=4fe89&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69379&l=4fe89&id=700485318</a>
