        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Manta Ray Resort</h1><p><small>Entry added on 06/12/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>The penultimate leg of our journey took us to Fiji, and the Yasawa Islands, mind you you'll probably know the ending to this story if you've read the previous posts, however I'll fill you in on the start and the middle. Hows about that then....<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After a night in Nadi Bay resort and a meeting with a shed load of massive frogs we were taken at stupid o'clock in the morning to the boat terminal where we boarded our ship that would take us to Manta Ray resort, where we were booked in to do very little apart from relax for 5 days.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The three hour boat trip took us past many other island resorts, including South Sea Island, which was so small you could have walked round in a minute, and beachcomber island, which is where all the young hip party people got off. Us more mature travellers continued onwards towards the northern Yasawas.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We arrived to be greeted by a traditional Fijian welcome and were shown to our Bure, a waterfront bedroom or as Ann-Marie called it, a shed!. We also randomly met up with Louis and Anthony, who were two guys we travelled to Fraser Island with way way back at the start off our adventure. Its a small small world etc etc.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The afternoon was spent snorkeling (see the pics linked from the last blog entry) and in the evening we sat down to a feast of food with the other islanders, and at night we were kept awake by the copious amounts of rain pounding down on our shed roof!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The next morning we decided to go on a visit to the local village on the neighbouring island which was where most of the staff from the resort lived. Its tough to accurately describe what the village was like, and how I felt walking round, so I won't bother.  The villagers lived a basic but happy existence, being mostly proud of their school and church. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;See the photos on the link below if you so fancy. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After the tour we had a chance to make a donation to the village and to buy souvenirs from the women in the village. Some of these were hand made trinkets. We were assured that the it was much cheaper to buy stuff from the villagers rather than on the mainland, but we've found out that wasn't entirely true. However, being hoodwinked by people that you can clearly see need the money isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless you're a tight-fisted money grabbing, heartless b**tard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Just as we were leaving I remembered that I had a bag of jellies in my man-bag, and so Bart went running off round the village handing out sweets to all the local kids. That was something I'll remember, not just because Bart gave away all the sweets and didn't keep a single one for herself, but purely because of the delight the kids and parents took for such a small act of kindness on our part. My heart was well and truly warmed, and in 40 degree heat thats saying something...<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The rest of the day was spent reading, snoozing, kayaking, playing volleyball, eating and being eaten by the bloody mozzies!!! In the evening some of the villagers came and danced for us. Which was nice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The following day we went out for a trek with a guide to a lookout on the island. The photos tell this story pretty well so I won't babble about it (although they won't tell you about the best culturally insensitive insult I've ever heard. It was class and no it wasn't me that came out with it, ask me sometime).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Bart is writing a separate entry about what she did that afternoon. The rest of the day was spent reading, snoozing, eating and being eaten by the bloody mozzies!!!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The following day we were both pretty tired and were surprised when the lunch drum sounded early although we thought nothing of it. That was until we found out we were being advised to leave that day because of the impending cyclone......<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74659&l=70d93&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74659&l=70d93&id=700485318</a>
