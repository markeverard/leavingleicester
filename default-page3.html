        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Find out what we're up to and where we've been.</p><h4>17/11/2007 - Queenstown!</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We arrived in Queenstown this morning and went to get eV registered for his bungy jump! We booked our activities the day before....eV decided to go for the biggest bungy in New Zealand (and I'll get to me later...)!&nbsp;&nbsp;I went along with eV in the bus along with fellow nutters (ahem..I mean thrill seekers) to the Nevis Highwire Bungy - a monster 134 metres (440 feet) drop.  After a 35min drive to the site, we all got harnessed up and got into a shuttle which took us over the canyon to ...</p><a href='default-id31.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>17/11/2007 - Franz Josef Glacier</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>After waking up in the layby we packed up and headed down the coast to the Franz Josef Glacier! &nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of blurb 'The Glacier descends deep into the lush rainforest of Westlandâ€™s National Park, from a height of 2700m above sea level to only 240m in as little as 11 km, making it the world's steepest and fastest flowing guided glacier.'  Franz Josef is one of only three temperate glaciers in the world (two of these are in NZ, the other in Argentina) so we definitely wanted to ...</p><a href='default-id30.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>17/11/2007 - Its a small world...</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Traveling the world makes you realise actually how small it is, or more likely how people of the same cultures and social backgrounds holiday in the same spots. Still......&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst in Hanmer Springs sitting in the hottest Sulphur pool; I mentioned to Ann-Marie that it smelt just like the famous Harrogate (spring) egg water. Two guys just getting in overheard me; and funnily enough one of them (Ben) was from Harrogate. Small world huh?

After the freezing (well, apparently it was 12 degrees but it felt like ice) waters around Kaikoura, the thermal pools here were blissful.  We started out in the 33 degree pool...then to the 36 and then to the lovely 39 :)  Then we played a few games (how far can you swim underwater using just your ...</p><a href='default-id28.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>17/11/2007 - Soft Rock</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Nope, I'm not talking about some geological formations, although there are plenty of those in New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead I'll take you through a situation Ann-Marie and I encountered on the first day of our camper van journey. No music. Thats correct, as soon as you head out of any built up area you lose any semblance of radio signal. Not good.&nbsp;&nbsp;To tide us through our travels, we stopped at a village petrol station and decided to pick up a CD, although I pushed the boat out and ...</p><a href='default-id27.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>15/11/2007 - How to charm a dolphin</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>If ever any of you are lucky enough to swim with dolphins then these tips may come in handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolphins are intelligent creatures. Treat them with respect. To gain their attention you must woo them appropriately. Making silly noises will only serve to scare not only the dolphins but also the fellow humans who are swimming with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead you must try some of the greatest love songs of our time but with one exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs dolphins especially like:&nbsp;* Close ...</p><a href='default-id26.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>15/11/2007 - An understanding of wildlife</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>As heard by my very own ears, when watching one of our  fast moving feathered friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;'' That bird is flying isn't it ''&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes it is.

I've often wondered what the most dangerous thing is about foreign cultures and lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can now reveal the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerbs!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes the most dangerous thing is that other countries have differing roadside kerb heights. Imagine the situation, you are casually walking across the road and without thinking go to step up. You take an English size step. But WAIT. This is New Zealand. Their kerbs are ...</p><a href='default-id24.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>15/11/2007 - Dolphin Encounter</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Woo-hoooooooooooooooo! eV and I have just been swimming with dolphins & it was awesome! They were so close and there was loads of them. At one point I had about 5 of them swimming underneath me and showing off!...they got so close and if you hold their attention they play with you and go round you in circles and as you try to copy and rotate with them they change directions, so basically you look like floundering fools but it was cool!  &nbsp;&nbsp;I was making tooting noises which eV said ...</p><a href='default-id23.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>14/11/2007 - Great Ocean Road</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We hired a car for a couple of days and headed out along the great ocean road!! We stopped at split point lighthouse and then drove on through to Lorne.  The drive was beautiful...better than I was expecting really. Lots of nice curving roads beside white sandy beaches and bright blue ocean. We also managed to fluke some amazing weather...lots & lots of sun and not a cloud in the sky...this is more like it! We stopped for a drink by a creek at Lorne and then drove through Apollo Bay until we ...</p><a href='default-id22.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><hr />Displaying entries (21-30) of 51</p><br /><a class='inlist' href='index.html'>&lt;&lt;</a> ... <a class='inlist' href='default-page1.html'>1</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page2.html'>2</a>&nbsp;| page 3 | <a class='inlist' href='default-page4.html'>4</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page5.html'>5</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>6</a>&nbsp;... <a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>&gt;&gt;</a>
