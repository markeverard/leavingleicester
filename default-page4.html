        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Find out what we're up to and where we've been.</p><h4>12/11/2007 - I said Yeeeeeeeah</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We've got one day left in Australia. I can't believe the time (and money) has gone so quick.&nbsp;&nbsp;To celebrate our last night we are going out to meet one of Australia's finest. Yep we're going drinking with the one and only James Gray. (Apologies to those that don't know anything about him - however trust me, tonight is going to be amazing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough blogging I'd better take the hire car back...

The sleepy fella had perched in a gum tree just by the great ocean road and was spotted by my very own eagle eyes. I realise that I probably should have been looking at the road but no matter.

Semi-recovering means that I felt fine as I have no trouble sleeping on buses (or anywhere for that matter) but Ann-Marie still felt a little tired as she couldn't sleep in the slightest. We went down to St Kilda to see the beach and grab a coffee before Clare and Tom left us to our own devices whilst they went to buy excessive ...</p><a href='default-id19.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>11/11/2007 - Scrambled eggs</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We're in Melbourne and Ann-Marie has just made me scrambled eggs.

Once she has been found in every photo then I'll post a special prize...................

The sun has got his hat on and is peeking out from behind the clouds. Its just a shame that this is the last day of our Sydney adventure. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've added some photos from the last three days, as Bart described in her last post. First up is the ferry ride and walk around Manly beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up is pictures from the evening where we went bat hunting in the Botanical gardens. Bats are great, especially when playing cricket.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally there are ...</p><a href='default-id16.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>08/11/2007 - Sydney</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Hey guys, we arrived in Sydney on Monday night & checked in to wake-up! hostel which is really rather nice. We decided to do the proper backpacker thing and buy food to cook up in our hostel as we're here for 4 nights (previously we've been dining out every night which is pretty expensive). So yeah, our hostel is in prime location in Sydney Central, on the corner of 2 main streets, which both lead to the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. &nbsp;&nbsp;So, after we landed we had a stoll down to ...</p><a href='default-id15.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>05/11/2007 - Everywhere you go... (Bart)</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Well, after being warned by fellow travellers of the unbearable heat and zillions of flys, we stocked up on sun cream and I bought myself a lovely hat that a beekeeper would be proud of :)&nbsp;&nbsp;So we get to Alice and it's a bit nippy with a few spots of rain. The shuttle bus driver at the airport was excited by this as it hadn't rained there since March.  No big deal we thought.  We had a wander around sleepy Alice, including a trip to the botanical gardens. This was a bit strange as it ...</p><a href='default-id14.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>05/11/2007 - Everywhere you go... (eV)</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>This is the story of our 3 day camping adventure to Uluru and Kings canyon as told by me!&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;The majority of the 3 days were spent driving. I reckon we did about 1500 km in total (About 1000 miles for those of you unwilling to understand metric), so it was lucky that we had an air-conditioned bus and had also stocked up on sunblock, as don't forget Uluru (Ayers Rock) is in the middle of the harsh unforgiving Great Australian Desert. I can certainly tell you that it is harsh and ...</p><a href='default-id13.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>01/11/2007 - Who the F*** is Alice?</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>(edit: I've just added a link to the photos)&nbsp;&nbsp;We've arrived in Alice Springs to be greeted by their first rainfall since March. Its a strange but nice place. I would have had some good pictures to show but I've forgotten to bring the memory card with me!&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you wondering; I have made a decision about climbing Ayers Rock, thanks to a guy that shared our taxi to the airport in Cairns this morning. He used to work as a tour guide down at Uluru and gave some pretty ...</p><a href='default-id12.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><hr />Displaying entries (31-40) of 51</p><br /><a class='inlist' href='default.html?'>&lt;&lt;</a> ... <a class='inlist' href='default-page1.html'>1</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page2.html'>2</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page3.html'>3</a>&nbsp;| page 4 | <a class='inlist' href='default-page5.html'>5</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>6</a>&nbsp;... <a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>&gt;&gt;</a>
