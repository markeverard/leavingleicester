        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>I said Yeeeeeeeah</h1><p><small>Entry added on 12/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>We've got one day left in Australia. I can't believe the time (and money) has gone so quick.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;To celebrate our last night we are going out to meet one of Australia's finest. Yep we're going drinking with the one and only James Gray. (Apologies to those that don't know anything about him - however trust me, tonight is going to be amazing)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Enough blogging I'd better take the hire car back...</p></p>
