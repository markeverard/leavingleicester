        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Rucksack MIA</h1><p><small>Entry added on 16/10/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Well we made it to Singapore safely...shame the same can't be said about by rucksack which is still missing in action.  So if you see me wearing the same clothes in all the pictures then that's why :( <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On a more positive note, it's lovely and warm here and we've spent most of the day at Sentosa Island where we went on the skyride and luge. eV nearly toppled off after taking a bend too fast but he lives to see another day. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On a less thrilling note, we've just been to M&S to pick me up some more pants :) Singapore is like a home from home really...same shops, everyone talking English, all the signs in English..the only strange thing seems to be that people leave a packet of tissues on cafe tables before they queue for their order to show that it's reserved, what's all that about?<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=61336&l=b2566&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=61336&l=b2566&id=700485318</a>
