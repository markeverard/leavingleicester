        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>The final day</h1><p><small>Entry added on 06/01/2008 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>We reached our final day. It didn't feel like it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Ian had managed to wangle the day off work and unfortunately Sarah must have caught the bug that I had the previous day which meant she couldn't go to work either.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;At my request we decided to make our way to the top of a mountain to take a good look over Vancouver.  No only did we get a great view we also got treated to many other tourists delights such as a showing of Charlie Brown's Christmas. I never realised quite how depressing Snoopy and his chums are. I wish they'd all just brighten up, I mean whats the worst that could happen?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The mountain was cold, but the view out over Vancouver was superb. We spend some time up there staring out towards the Pacific but eventually we had to leave in order to make our flight home, stopping via a shopping mall - to do some last minute shopping - as Ann-Marie hadn't had time to do any during our travels, still it was good times hanging with Ian, and finally making him realise that his eyes are too close together. (Actually I believe the dawning of this undeniable truth may have made him have a little accident.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We got to the airport in plenty of time, but yet again our flight was delayed, however this enabled us to savour a few more minutes of holiday in the airport bar, before it shut for the night (at 8pm what sort of airport bar is that - I'll tell you - a rubbish one - thats what) and so we had to sit patiently in the departure lounge as our holiday came to a close......<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=82606&l=e1f3a&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=82606&l=e1f3a&id=700485318</a>
