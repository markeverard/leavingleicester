        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Scuba scuba scuba</h1><p><small>Entry added on 31/10/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>So we made it to Cairns after another marathon bus journey. The only problem was arriving in the city at 6:05am both hungry and tired (note this was more of a problem for Ann-Marie than me - all of you fellows Stobbarts will no doubt understand what I mean)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The hostel we're staying is cool and hot. Cool in the sense its in an old converted cinema and hot in the sense that we didn't turn the air conditioning on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Yesterday we recovered from the bus journey, and went wake-boarding (knee boarding actually) in the afternoon. I'll upload the video to Facebook at some point. Ann-Marie's shriek is pretty funny!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Today we were up at 6:00am (I got the pick up time spot on this time so I didn't get us up an hour and a half earlier than needed - did Ann-Marie mention that in her Whitsunday report? ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We traveled up to Port Douglas where we took a one day introductory Scuba diving trip out to the Great Barrier Reef. Wow! What an amazing experience and many other superlatives. (Note to Dad and Julie - I made a big mistake chickening out of diving with you guys all those years ago, I've made up for it now though)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We didn't take our underwater camera with us, as it doesn't work down at 12 metres (the maximum depth we dived to) and we'd used up all of the pictures snorkeling at Whitsundays.  However there are some pictures taken by an on board photographer of us in our gear and some lovely little colourful fishies!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Cairns is finished after tonight and some beers. Next stop Alice Springs, the outback and Uluru where we face a moral dilemma, which hopefully you can help us with. The aborigines request that no one climbs to the top of Uluru but won't stop anyone from doing so. Should we climb it or not? I know when I get there that getting to the top will be foremost on my mind, but is it unethical? Leave a message on our messageboard to help us decide.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Until next time.......<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=65413&l=96c1b&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=65413&l=96c1b&id=700485318</a>
