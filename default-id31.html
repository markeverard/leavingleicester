        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Queenstown!</h1><p><small>Entry added on 17/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>We arrived in Queenstown this morning and went to get eV registered for his bungy jump! We booked our activities the day before....eV decided to go for the biggest bungy in New Zealand (and I'll get to me later...)!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I went along with eV in the bus along with fellow nutters (ahem..I mean thrill seekers) to the Nevis Highwire Bungy - a monster 134 metres (440 feet) drop.  After a 35min drive to the site, we all got harnessed up and got into a shuttle which took us over the canyon to the bungy pod!  This was utterly amazing/terrifying.  As soon as I got into the pod I was glad I was just watching! It's just a little metal shed hanging over a canyon with one hell of a drop!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;eV was second to jump and he did himself proud...no hesitation..... 3-2-1-BUNGY!!!!... off he went... hurtling into the canyon...headed for the rock face! I was more nervous then he was!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It looked awesome and although almost everyone was scared witless about doing it they all loved it and raved about it afterwards...some even doing a second jump there and then!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Far too scary....it did look great but I don't think I'd have the bottle to jump! It looks like suicide!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway... after this adrenaline rush, we headed to my activity choice.... a 12000ft skydive!  I felt fine about it...after beign terrified just watching the bungy I though this would be relatively tame :) Afterall, It'd be a  tandem dive with a qualified dude who pulls open the parachute...what's so scary about that?...<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Well, all was going well, we got suited up and got into the tiniest plane I've ever been in...it fit 9 of us in there (3 people doing the jump for the first time plus an instructor each and we each had our own camera-man to jump out with us and video the whole thing!) but we were packed like sardines...no extra space and not even a door ;).  Well at this point I was feeling pretty nervous..and even more so when the plane started to climb..and climb..and climb...up above the highest mountains and still going! At almost 4km in the air it was time to jump! Holy moly!  I was positioned at the back so I was the last out ....which just meant more time to be nervous! ;)....we shuffled along to the edge of the plane...hanging out the door and then all of a sudden we were out! That point was the scariest thing I've ever done! The difference between being in the plane and just dropping was crazy! The first few seconds were mental!! We were in free-fall for quite a while..a minute maybe..and we were whirling everywhere so fast...cool! It was so noisy too...wind rushing past at 200km/hr!! Then at just over a kilometre from the ground, he pulled the chute open and it was such a contrast...really quiet and peaceful and gliding down in circles...amazing...amazing...amazing!  Then just soaked up the views and felt giddy (still do!).  Would definitely recommend it :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Ok..I should go and calm down somewhere!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Bye for now!!!!!!!<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69966&l=35414&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69966&l=35414&id=700485318</a>
