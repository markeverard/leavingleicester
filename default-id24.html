        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>The perils of international travel</h1><p><small>Entry added on 15/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>During our time abroad, and on other occasions I've left the motherland. I've often wondered what the most dangerous thing is about foreign cultures and lands.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I can now reveal the answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Kerbs!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Yes the most dangerous thing is that other countries have differing roadside kerb heights. Imagine the situation, you are casually walking across the road and without thinking go to step up. You take an English size step. But WAIT. This is New Zealand. Their kerbs are much higher. What follows is an ungainly and unstoppable trip, resulting in embarassment and potentially a fall.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;This is a problem that affects all international travellers. You have been warned<br>&nbsp;</p></p>
