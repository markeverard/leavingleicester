        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Its a small world...</h1><p><small>Entry added on 17/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Traveling the world makes you realise actually how small it is, or more likely how people of the same cultures and social backgrounds holiday in the same spots. Still......<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Whilst in Hanmer Springs sitting in the hottest Sulphur pool; I mentioned to Ann-Marie that it smelt just like the famous Harrogate (spring) egg water. Two guys just getting in overheard me; and funnily enough one of them (Ben) was from Harrogate. Small world huh? Whilst we were chatting away about all things Yorkshire, his mate (Oliver) and Ann-Marie got talking and discovered that they are both starting at Accenture in January on the same day. Smaller world huh? <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So Ann-Marie has made her first work buddy (in a pool in a small New Zealand thermal spa resort)</p></p>
