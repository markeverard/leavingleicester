        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>English Rugby</h1><p><small>Entry added on 14/10/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Amazing. I get to watch England play in the rugby world cup final somewhere along the east coast of Australia. I'll enjoy that. I won't enjoy the fact that it will be at stupid o'clock in the morning. I guess kick off will be about 8am or something. We can pretty much write that whole day off then. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We're sat around waiting for the first of a total of 10 flights. First stop Singapore, which will take about 12 hours or so. I'm sure Ann-Marie will try to marathon 4-5 movies in a row to make the flight go quicker. Obviously I just mean make the time pass quicker as I don't think that one passenger watching the on-flight entertainment could actually increase the plane's top-speed, although I wish it could. Scientists; make it so...<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We fly at 10pm. Its now about 6pm. I'm aready bored. <br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=61333&l=71004&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=61333&l=71004&id=700485318</a>
