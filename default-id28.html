        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Hanmer Springs</h1><p><small>Entry added on 17/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>After our dip with the dolphins we started to make our way to the west coast and along the way we stopped off at the hot springs and mineral pools in the alpine village of Hanmer Springs.  After the freezing (well, apparently it was 12 degrees but it felt like ice) waters around Kaikoura, the thermal pools here were blissful.  We started out in the 33 degree pool...then to the 36 and then to the lovely 39 :)  Then we played a few games (how far can you swim underwater using just your hands/legs/a kick from the wall) in the 28 degree swimming pool before braving the 40 degree sulphur pools! Felt like I was being steamed alive in rotten egg water...nice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After this we hit the road again for another 3 and a half hour hours until we got to Greymouth, where we camped in a layby!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We're having an awesome time but one week in a campervan is not enough to appreciate New Zealand. We're having to motor 6hrs a day to get round everywhere but the views are amazing. It's also great to be the only ones on the road for the majority of the drive. In 6hrs we see maybe a dozen cars (and a thousand plus sheep).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Vroom vroom...<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69960&l=8019a&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69960&l=8019a&id=700485318</a>
