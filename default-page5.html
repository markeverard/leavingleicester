        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Find out what we're up to and where we've been.</p><h4>31/10/2007 - Kangeroooooooooo</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We had our first Kangeroo sighting today!&nbsp;

The only problem was arriving in the city at 6:05am both hungry and tired (note this was more of a problem for Ann-Marie than me - all of you fellows Stobbarts will no doubt understand what I mean)&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostel we're staying is cool and hot. Cool in the sense its in an old converted cinema and hot in the sense that we didn't turn the air conditioning on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we recovered from the bus journey, and went ...</p><a href='default-id10.html.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>31/10/2007 - Whitsunday musings </h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Oh, what an amazing three days,&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing cross waters, to beautiful fish filled bays,&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I've just remembered that my poetry's so-so,&nbsp;&nbsp;But this trip left me enchanted, so I gave it a go!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I booked our Singapore 1-star accommodation a few weeks back. At 30 pounds a night it seemed too good to be true&nbsp;&nbsp;2) When arriving at the hotel check out the local area. In our ...</p><a href='default-id5.html.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>18/10/2007 - Rucksack BIA</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>The rucksack has been found!

So if you see me wearing the same clothes in all the pictures then that's why :( &nbsp;&nbsp;On a more positive note, it's lovely and warm here and we've spent most of the day at Sentosa Island where we went on the skyride and luge. eV nearly toppled off after taking a bend too fast but he lives to see another day. &nbsp;&nbsp;On a less thrilling note, we've just been to M&S ...</p><a href='default-id3.html.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>14/10/2007 - English Rugby</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Amazing. I get to watch England play in the rugby world cup final somewhere along the east coast of Australia. I'll enjoy that. I won't enjoy the fact that it will be at stupid o'clock in the morning. I guess kick off will be about 8am or something. We can pretty much write that whole day off then. &nbsp;&nbsp;We're sat around waiting for the first of a total of 10 flights. First stop Singapore, which will take about 12 hours or so. I'm sure Ann-Marie will try to marathon 4-5 movies in a row to ...</p><a href='default-id2.html.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><hr />Displaying entries (41-50) of 51</p><br /><a class='inlist' href='index.html'>&lt;&lt;</a> ... <a class='inlist' href='default-page2.html'>2</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page3.html'>3</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page4.html'>4</a>&nbsp;| page 5 | <a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>6</a>&nbsp;... <a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>&gt;&gt;</a>
