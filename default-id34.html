        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>The Cloud Piercer</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>After the excitment of Queenstown again, we headed towards Mount Cook (the highest mountain in Australiasia) stopping along the way for an overnight stop in Twisel.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After witnessing Milford Sound I really didn't expect to see anyhing that could rival the sights and views I'd seen there. I was wrong, the drive to Mt Cook took us past Lake Pukaki which was stunning! I didn't think water could be that colour blue (for those of you that care, the colour is caused by the sediment carried by the water, called rock flour). <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Mt Cook village is located 20km (thats a guess) from the base of Mt Cook and gives fantasticly clear views of the summit.  There isn't much else to do in the village but to be honest you don't need much else.&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we decided we did need was to go Kayaking up the river to the base of the Mueller glacier, past (some) mini ice-bergs that were floating along in the 0.5 degree water! &nbsp;&nbsp;Near freezing water is very cold. If we'd have fallen in then you can get hypothermia within a minute, which didn't bode well for inexperienced kayakers like us. However we took to our 2-man Kayak like a duck to cold water, and the wettest I got was when I accused my fellow Kayaker of fanny-paddling. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It was thirsty work paddling upstream against the wind, however luckily we were paddling on freshly melted glacier which is beautiful fresh pure crisp water. Much better than any of your bottled spring rubbish, and much cheaper!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We stopped off for a brief walk around on base of the glacier, which was covered with a thick layer of rocks / dirt, so it didn't feel much like ice apart from when larger chunks melted off. It was strange to think that the Franz-Josef glacier was only 50 km on the other side of the mountains. We'd driven about 400 km to get round.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We left Mt Cook and drove towards the lakeside resort of Lake Tekapo where we found a pub for the night, and went paddling in the freezing lake. We also stopped at the 'Church of the Good Shepherd' to watch the vicar chase away bus loads of Japanese tourists taking pictures. After they'd gone we took some pictures and made our way towards Christchurch.</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72946&l=d83dc&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72946&l=d83dc&id=700485318</a>
