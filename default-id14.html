        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Everywhere you go... (Bart)</h1><p><small>Entry added on 05/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Well, after being warned by fellow travellers of the unbearable heat and zillions of flys, we stocked up on sun cream and I bought myself a lovely hat that a beekeeper would be proud of :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So we get to Alice and it's a bit nippy with a few spots of rain. The shuttle bus driver at the airport was excited by this as it hadn't rained there since March.  No big deal we thought.  We had a wander around sleepy Alice, including a trip to the botanical gardens. This was a bit strange as it looked sparse compared to what you'd expect for a botanical garden...but then we were in the outback! <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway...next morning we're up at 5.30am (this is becoming a habit)..and we set off on the long trek to Uluru.  It's raining quite a bit and we pass through some decent patches of flooded roads. Again, our tour guide is excited as he's never seen the local rivers with water in them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The first leg of our journey was Kata Tjuta National Park. We went on a walk around the Olgas (big rock formations near to Ayers rock itself).  It's pretty cool with the rain as we get to see waterfalls from the rocks (which again we were told is really rare) and we also manage to see a spectacular double rainbow over the rocks.  However, we did get extremely soaked and had to dodge streams and slippery slopes galore.&nbsp;&nbsp;We head to camp for lunch and then we head out to watch the sunset on Uluru with champers and biccies.  Unfortunately the clouds were still lingering so we actually witnessed a general darkening.... but the colours were still amazing. Not so much on the rock, but the contrast with the  the sky+plants+sand was awesome (see pics :)).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway, we set up camp for the night and then got up at 4am (this is getting silly) so we could watch the sunrise at Uluru. Again, pesky clouds were not cooperative but we managed some cool pics (mainly the one with the kangaroo sign with uluru in the background...very touristy :)).  After that we did the Uluru 9km base walk...stopping off at the watering holes and teaching caves where you could see original aboriginee paintings.  We looked around the cultural centre and our guide told us about some of the history so that was pretty cool.  After all this we headed off to Kings Canyon. Until this point it wasn't clear if we'd be able to go here as the roads had been flooded and a previous group had been trapped there for 5 days!  We made it there in good time though and made an awesome bonfire for us to cook up our dinner :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Final day and we're up at 6am...we head to Kings Canyon and follow a steep climb to the top and head on a tour around the canyon and the oasis known as the garden of eden.  It's been raining lightly but steadily most of the day and we hear rumors of roads flooding if the rain gets any worse. It gets worse ;) ...the rain comes down heavier and heavier...we get caught in the biggest thunder and lightening storm I've ever experienced!! The top of a mountain isn't the greatest place to be....we try to get down as quickly as possible....it's fun at first and people are laughing and eV and I start a chorus of 'signing in the rain' and 'zipideedooda' but this wears off after more than an hour of slipping down rocks and stepping in streams and being generally freezing and wet. We all climb on the bus...I change into the only dry clothes I have left....my pyjamas :) .  Thankfully we made it through the flooded roads and got back to Alice for a group meal/party :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So...that was our outback camping adventure. In some cases we were lucky to have seen the things we did...but I'd still take the sunshine anyday :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;See you in Sydney!<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66769&l=1b8a8&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66769&l=1b8a8&id=700485318</a>
