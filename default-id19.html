        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Barbie.....</h1><p><small>Entry added on 12/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Melbourne is a fantastic city, made all the better by our kind hosts, Tom and Clare.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Saturday was spent semi-recovering from our overnight bus journey. Semi-recovering means that I felt fine as I have no trouble sleeping on buses (or anywhere for that matter) but Ann-Marie still felt a little tired as she couldn't sleep in the slightest. We went down to St Kilda to see the beach and grab a coffee before Clare and Tom left us to our own devices whilst they went to buy excessive amounts of dead animal to throw on the BBQ (which was planned for Sunday).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A quick (free as we didn't buy a ticket) tram ride took up us to the botanical gardens where we strolled round a market, ate crepes and soaked up the beautiful sunshine.&nbsp;&nbsp;A beer or two enabled me to painlessly accompany Ann-Marie shopping. Beer motivation also encouraged me to purchase a new pair of shoes.....  <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the evening we explored South Bank and visited one of many pubs in a shopping centre (it just doesn't feel right) then we made a short trip to the casino which put the Leicester Gala firmly in the shade, however we were all a bit tired / drunk / poor to gamble so we headed home for the night.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Tom invited me to play as a ringer in a Sunday morning medics football tourny. It doesn't matter what part of the world I'm in - nothing can stop me saying yes to a bit of footy and the role of a rent-a-keeper. We finished 4th from 7 which was a fair effort although worryingly the team scored most of their goals and secured a stunning fight back when I was off the field which is also what is happening back in Leicester at the Accies (http://www.leicesteracademicals.com).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon was BBQ time, which involved beer, sunshine and meat. Good times.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Monday and Tuesday were planned as a trip along the Great Ocean Road. I'll post about that later - and add some photos to this entry. I would have done it now but I can't for the life of me work out how to use this Mac. Give me a PC anyday)<br>&nbsp;</p></p>
