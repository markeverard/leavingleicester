        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>How to charm a dolphin</h1><p><small>Entry added on 15/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>If ever any of you are lucky enough to swim with dolphins then these tips may come in handy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Dolphins are intelligent creatures. Treat them with respect. To gain their attention you must woo them appropriately. Making silly noises will only serve to scare not only the dolphins but also the fellow humans who are swimming with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Instead you must try some of the greatest love songs of our time but with one exception.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Songs dolphins especially like:<br>&nbsp;* Close to you - The Carpenters - This is particularly effective<br>&nbsp;For a more upbeat song try:<br>&nbsp;* Copacabana - Barry Manilow<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;However under no circumstances sing Barry White. Although he wrote some of the most effective human love songs of all time they do not work on dolphins. The reason for this is that Barry White looked too much like a Walrus (a natural enemy of the Dolphin)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I hope this helps<br>&nbsp; </p></p>
