        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>North Island mini-adventure day 1</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>On Monday we went into Wellington city and visited Te Papa (New Zealand's national museum).  This had 5 floors of exhibitions about the history and culture of NZ including wildlife displays and a cool earthquake room. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On Tuesday we set off in our hire car to explore the North Island for a couple of days. We made the long trek north to Lake Taupo which is New Zealand's largest fresh water lake and was formed by a massive volcanic eruption about 27,000 yrs ago.  Not having much time to spare, we drove around the lake and headed to the Craters of the Moon - an  active geothermal area which looks like waste land splattered with craters, steam vents and bubbling thermal mud pools. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After a loop of this area we headed to Orakei Korako Cave and Thermal Park.  The only way to get to the park is via a little boat crossing the Waikato River.  It felt like a real secret get-away as hardly anyone else was there because we'd arrived late in the afternoon.  The park was full of amazing colours...orange silica terraces, bright blue pools,  bubbling mud pools, pink and emerald algae.  <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Probably the best bit about the park was the thermal Ruatapu Cave. To get to the cave we walked down 120ft of steps to find a hot jade green pool at the bottom.  The guide book had said to be careful near the water as you might find yourself standing in the pool.  Good advice but it didn't help much...it's almost impossible to tell where the water starts so i ended up plodding into it and my flip flop floated off. Mark was highly amused until he did the exact same thing. And then, just for good measure,  I ended up doing it again :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After this we headed to our final destination of that day - Rotorua.  This area is also well-known for geothermal activity and constantly smells of rotten eggs. Nice :)  After checking in to our hostel we went to the Polynesian Spa which had lots of outdoor thermal pools (alkali and acidic) of varying temperatures.  Despite the smell it was a great place to relax...especially as the pools look out on to the lake and by the time we got there the sun was setting.  The spa was open late so you could sit in the hot pools and watch the stars come out to play...a good end to the first day of our adventure.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72985&l=002d5&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72985&l=002d5&id=700485318</a>
