        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Who the F*** is Alice?</h1><p><small>Entry added on 01/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>(edit: I've just added a link to the photos)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We've arrived in Alice Springs to be greeted by their first rainfall since March. Its a strange but nice place. I would have had some good pictures to show but I've forgotten to bring the memory card with me!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;For those of you wondering; I have made a decision about climbing Ayers Rock, thanks to a guy that shared our taxi to the airport in Cairns this morning. He used to work as a tour guide down at Uluru and gave some pretty compelling advice not to climb the rock. (I can't remember exactly what it was - but I can remember that it had me convinced!).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;As our lonely Planet guide puts it - you wouldn't climb all over the altar at Notre Dame - or walk through a mosque during prayer time (Actually I can imagine Dave Wilson doing that) so why would you climb over another religions sacred place. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I feel a better man for making that decision. I might not be able to get a good view from the top of the rock, but the view from the moral high ground is superb!<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66759&l=0e833&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66759&l=0e833&id=700485318</a>
