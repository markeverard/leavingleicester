        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Bungy Curious</h1><p><small>Entry added on 22/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Well, after the adrenaline rush of Queenstown we headed to the delightful Milford Sound (see Mark's entry!).  Then after that we had to start making our way north again so we could drop off our campervan.  There aren't many roads in NZ so we had to take the one that went through Queenstown.  <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Ever since I'd watched eV and the others do the terrifying Nevis bungy, I'd been thinking about doing one more and more. Never thought I would do such a silly thing but it was getting to the point where I'd thought about it so much that if I didn't do it then I'd regret it (if that makes sense).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So, when we got back to Queenstown we went out to the Kawaru Bridge Bungy, which was the first ever commercial bungy site.  It's a really pretty area...the river underneath is bright blue and the sun was shining.  We went out to the viewing platform and watched a few jumps! I felt sick watching :)  I met a girl there who was thinking about doing it as well but was also really nervous!  After a lot of umm-ing and ahh-ing we decided to take the plunge!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;When I was up on the bridge I think my brain was pretending it wasn't happening.  I was happily chatting to the bungy guy while he was wrapping my feet together  but when it came to standing up and looking out over the jump I was really scared.  It all happened so fast... 3-2-1-GO and I was plummeting to the river. I screamed like a little girl and then was relieved to feel the bungy kick in and throw me around!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It was the scariest thing I've ever done but it felt great once I could feel the bungy!  Awesome experience!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway..I think that's enough excitement for a while..but we'll see :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=71281&l=bf7bc&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=71281&l=bf7bc&id=700485318</a>
