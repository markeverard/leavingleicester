        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Sydney</h1><p><small>Entry added on 08/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Hey guys, we arrived in Sydney on Monday night & checked in to wake-up! hostel which is really rather nice. We decided to do the proper backpacker thing and buy food to cook up in our hostel as we're here for 4 nights (previously we've been dining out every night which is pretty expensive). So yeah, our hostel is in prime location in Sydney Central, on the corner of 2 main streets, which both lead to the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So, after we landed we had a stoll down to those famous landmarks and took plenty of pictures.  The opera house is amazing at night....I was so exited when we first saw it :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;At this point I gave Becks a ring because as some of you may know she was propsed to near this area.  We saw the excellent restaurant where they had their meal...it had cool pirate ship masts stuck on the outside :) Looked very swank. And we went to the grassy area and took piccies just for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the palm trees around this area we could see loads of bats flapping about which was rather cool.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Sydney - Day 2:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Rain rain rain :( What is going on?  We were clearly spoilt for our first week and now it's payback.  Anyway, today was the big Melbourne Cup race...which everyone goes bonkers about! As we were walking round the streets we saw loads of people in their finest get-up (hats and all!).   We headed to Sydney Botanical Gardens which was beautiful! We saw absolutely loads of bats sleeping in the trees and made a note to come back at dusk to see them wake up.  We also payed a closer visit to the Opera House which was cool but looked prettier in the evenings.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Sydney - Day 3:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;No rain but it's cold :( <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Today we took the ferry to Manly and had lunch near the beach and watched the surfers. It's strange seeing all the kids coming straight from school carrying their boards :)  We had a scenic walk here before heading back to the botanical gardens to catch the bats waking up.  It took a while....but it was worth it when it happened! So many of the little critters :) Getting photos was hard work...we must have taken a dozen for every half decent one...(will upload later).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Sydney - Day 4:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Trip to the Blue Mountains (sadly with the rain following us all the way there).  We stopped off at Featherdale wildlife centre and fed the wallabies and kangaroos which were happily hoping about and would eat from your hand.  Also had a piccie with a koala..very cute!  We also so a croc and various other creatures including eV's favourite....a wombat...which was way bigger than we were expecting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Then off to the Blue Mountains. I'm told it's gorgeous in the sunlight...the area is blue due to sunlight reflecting from the oil from the eucalyptus plants...however the sun did not have his hat on today.  At one point all the mountains were covered in cloud but it did clear at times and we managed to see the 3 sisters from Echo Point.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After that we went down the worlds steepest railway which leads us to what used to be an old coal mining area, so that was nifty. (Apparently it's on the 100 things to do before you die list...so we can cross that one off :))  On our way back we stopped at a boutique winery for some lovely tasting with cheese and biscuits.  Finally we took the SeaCat back to Sydney harbour and then strolled back to our hostel.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Fingers crossed for good weather tomorrow so we can head to Bondi Beach!  Tomorrow evening we're getting the 12hr bus (!) to Melbourne and meeting up with Tom & Clare which will be very nice indeed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Ok, that's it for now!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Bye bye  <br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=67179&l=178f7&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=67179&l=178f7&id=700485318</a>
