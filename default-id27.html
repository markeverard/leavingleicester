        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Soft Rock</h1><p><small>Entry added on 17/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Nope, I'm not talking about some geological formations, although there are plenty of those in New Zealand.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Instead I'll take you through a situation Ann-Marie and I encountered on the first day of our camper van journey. No music. Thats correct, as soon as you head out of any built up area you lose any semblance of radio signal. Not good.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;To tide us through our travels, we stopped at a village petrol station and decided to pick up a CD, although I pushed the boat out and persuaded Ann-Marie to buy two. Now I can tell you that the selection in a rural New Zealand gas station isn't that great. However we picked up 2 beauties that have kept our spirits high through our hours of arduous campervan-ing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;1. The 2CD Jim Bean Shot party selection compilation - featured one cd of classic 80's tunes, and another of local kiwi classics. T -Rex children of the revolution, rocks! <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;2. The legends of soft rock are back. Yes The Eagles have (re) landed 25 years after breaking up and we are lucky enough to own a copy of their comeback album. I highly recommend you check it out.  Status Quo have got nothing on these guys. This is one CD that everyone must buy*<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;(* note, you should only buy this album if you only have a choice of 3 cd's to choose from, one of which you bought, and the other of which is Now 25.) <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p>
