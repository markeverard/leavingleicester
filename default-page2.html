        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Find out what we're up to and where we've been.</p><h4>04/12/2007 - Fiji time</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Amazing - the internet exists in Fiji!&nbsp;&nbsp;We're just chilling in Fiji, soaking up too much sun and relaxing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet

Being hungover may also have played a part in that, but ignore that fact for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;!! NOW AVAILABLE: Photos from the previous beer night !!&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect to see many messages of gratitude on the messgeboard. You may also spot that the entries don't appear in the correct order, but I'm sure you clever people can ...</p><a href='default-id40.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>29/11/2007 - Rafting - black</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We're no rafting racists - so along with white water rafting we also signed up to go black water rafting. To be honest the main attraction here wasn't the rafting but actually the glow-worms that light up the caves.&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed the previous night in Waitomo (a brief 2 hour drive from Roto-vegas). There are various ways of exploring the caves and underground caverns in Waitomo, from boring walking to more exciting abseiling to the option we chose of black water rafting - which actually ...</p><a href='default-id39.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>29/11/2007 - Rafting - white</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Rotorua AKA Roto-vegas, the home of more crazy extreme activities. This time Bart and I decided we would partake in Rafting of the white water kind and also zorbing - (which for those of you not in the know is pretending to be a hamster and climbing in a big ball and rolling yourself down a hill).&nbsp;&nbsp;I also unwittingly took part in the most extreme of all activities, one that produced a multitude of contrasting emotions. I call this activity losing the rental car keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ...</p><a href='default-id38.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>29/11/2007 - North Island mini-adventure day 1</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>On Monday we went into Wellington city and visited Te Papa (New Zealand's national museum).  This had 5 floors of exhibitions about the history and culture of NZ including wildlife displays and a cool earthquake room. &nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday we set off in our hire car to explore the North Island for a couple of days. We made the long trek north to Lake Taupo which is New Zealand's largest fresh water lake and was formed by a massive volcanic eruption about 27,000 yrs ago.  Not having much time ...</p><a href='default-id37.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>29/11/2007 - You Can't Beat Wellington.......</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Wayne and Ned kindly offered to pick us up from Wellington airport at 730am on a Saturday morning and Wayne certainly looked like he'd enjoyed his Friday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;We got back to Casa del Waynedda at about 830am and promptly cracked open some breakfast beers, fired up the BBQ and were cooked a fry up, on the condition that my beard was dismantled. After the fuzz had gone we sat down to watch England - Croatia game that Wayne had recorded. This necessitated some more beer and so the tone ...</p><a href='default-id36.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>29/11/2007 - 2500 km later....</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>After racking up 2500km we safely returned our campervan to Christchurch ending our 7 day race around the South Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;Christchurch is a nice city. Thats about all you can write about it. By all means check out the two photos we took of the place. We chilled out for a day before catching a stoopid o'clock in the morning plane to Wellington.&nbsp;

I was wrong, the drive to Mt Cook took us past Lake Pukaki which was stunning! I didn't think water could be that colour blue (for those of you that care, the colour is caused by the sediment carried ...</p><a href='default-id34.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>22/11/2007 - Bungy Curious</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Well, after the adrenaline rush of Queenstown we headed to the delightful Milford Sound (see Mark's entry!).  Then after that we had to start making our way north again so we could drop off our campervan.  There aren't many roads in NZ so we had to take the one that went through Queenstown.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since I'd watched eV and the others do the terrifying Nevis bungy, I'd been thinking about doing one more and more. Never thought I would do such a silly thing but it was getting to the ...</p><a href='default-id33.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>22/11/2007 - The sound of silence</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Fact of the day: New Zealand is nicknamed the Godzone. Why? Because its 'God's own' country, if the creator were to make himself a place then this would surely be it. &nbsp;&nbsp;We had a long drive to reach Milford Sound but it was most definitely worth it. Situated in the heart of Fiordland (for some reason the NZ's spell Fjord with an i) it is probably one of the most beautiful places I've laid eyes on, hopefully the photos will show you that, although trust me they don't do it ...</p><a href='default-id32.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><hr />Displaying entries (11-20) of 51</p><br /><a class='inlist' href='default.html?'>&lt;&lt;</a> ... <a class='inlist' href='default-page1.html'>1</a>&nbsp;| page 2 | <a class='inlist' href='default-page3.html'>3</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page4.html'>4</a>&nbsp;<a class='inlist' href='default-page5.html'>5</a>&nbsp;... <a class='inlist' href='default-page6.html'>&gt;&gt;</a>
