        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Couch potatoes</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>I hope you all realise that we've spend a whole day sat around writing blog entries and uploading photos for you guys to enjoy rather than exploring more of Wellington! Being hungover may also have played a part in that, but ignore that fact for now.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<strong>!! NOW AVAILABLE: Photos from the previous beer night !!</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I expect to see many messages of gratitude on the messgeboard. You may also spot that the entries don't appear in the correct order, but I'm sure you clever people can figure it out. (Edit: I've fixed the ordering problem now - with a little help from my Dad. I've also added a funky facebook badge). It's almost like I make websites for a living you know........&nbsp;&nbsp;It's beer o'clock.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74654&l=618d2&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74654&l=618d2&id=700485318</a>
