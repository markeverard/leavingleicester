        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Getting to Vancouver</h1><p><small>Entry added on 11/12/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Escaping Fiji is no easy task, but after 24 disrupted hours we managed it by flying via Los Angeles International (LAX), one of the world's busiest airports at one of its busiest times. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Everybody hates LAX, and its easy to see why. We landed on time but were 30 minutes late by the time we'd taxi'ed to the gate. Despite us being transfer passengers we still had to go through customs to officially enter the US, although for the first time I can remember we had a chatty US custom's official. Mind you, he was only chatting about how much he hated the airport as he had to work 16 hour shifts with only a half an hour break.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Three hours to make a connection should be enough, but after all that farting and faffing around and then being selected for a severe security check (by severe I mean that rubber gloves were used) we only made our flight to Vancouver with minutes to spare.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Luckily that was the last of our travel woes and We made it to Vancouver on time where Ian and Sarah kindly picked us up from the airport and drove us to their place. It only could have been better had Ian actually known the way to his house ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We were pretty tired after all that so we had a quite night in, meeting Do-g the dog (what do you mean you've finished stroking me. I politely and cutely demand more attention) and watching the Hatton - Mayweather fight.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;As could have been predicted we slept in until a little too late the next day....    <br>&nbsp;</p></p>
