        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Find out what we're up to and where we've been.</p><h4>06/01/2008 - The final day</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We reached our final day. It didn't feel like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian had managed to wangle the day off work and unfortunately Sarah must have caught the bug that I had the previous day which meant she couldn't go to work either.&nbsp;&nbsp;At my request we decided to make our way to the top of a mountain to take a good look over Vancouver.  No only did we get a great view we also got treated to many other tourists delights such as a showing of Charlie Brown's Christmas. I never realised quite how ...</p><a href='default-id52.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>11/12/2007 - A nothing day</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Monday was a lazy day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt ill and to make me feel better we decided on a course of retail therapy in downtown Vancouver. At the end of the day Ann-Marie felt much better and I still felt a bit ropey.&nbsp;

Most surprising were the huge piles of bright yellow curry spice being offloaded from some of the massive oil tanker like ships. I never knew that ...</p><a href='default-id49.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>11/12/2007 - Getting to Vancouver</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Escaping Fiji is no easy task, but after 24 disrupted hours we managed it by flying via Los Angeles International (LAX), one of the world's busiest airports at one of its busiest times. &nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody hates LAX, and its easy to see why. We landed on time but were 30 minutes late by the time we'd taxi'ed to the gate. Despite us being transfer passengers we still had to go through customs to officially enter the US, although for the first time I can remember we had a chatty US custom's ...</p><a href='default-id48.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>11/12/2007 - The last day</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Its nearly over. Tonight we head back to London. It will be strange adjusting to the real world again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in case you hadn't realised. We made it to Vancouver and very nice (and cold) it is too. At least it really feels like December now.

We took off, had food, got to sleep, slept and dreamt well only yo be woken by the 'cabin crew prepare for landing' announcement. Sweet, we'd managed to sleep for the whole 6 hours of the first leg of the flight to ...</p><a href='default-id46.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>06/12/2007 - Diving at Manta Ray</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>I've just written a massive entry about this but then when I uploaded the pics it disappeared :( So..here's an abbreviated version.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went diving on the 3rd day at Manta ray and it was awesome. The main guy took me out and we walked straight into the sea from the beach and began the dive from there.  It was so cool to be just the two of us cos he got to show me loads of stuff and I got to hold wierd things like sea pineapples, starfish and even got to touch some coral (usually you're ...</p><a href='default-id45.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>06/12/2007 - Manta Ray Resort</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>The penultimate leg of our journey took us to Fiji, and the Yasawa Islands, mind you you'll probably know the ending to this story if you've read the previous posts, however I'll fill you in on the start and the middle. Hows about that then....&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night in Nadi Bay resort and a meeting with a shed load of massive frogs we were taken at stupid o'clock in the morning to the boat terminal where we boarded our ship that would take us to Manta Ray resort, where we were booked in to ...</p><a href='default-id44.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>06/12/2007 - The calm before the storm</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>Well, we're still sitting, waiting, hoping that our flight is still going to fly tonight. So far its still scheduled but it doesn't look too promising.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyclone Daman has intensified to a Category 4 at the last report, its path is taking it over Vanua Levu, one of the two main islands in Fiji. We're sat in Nadi which is in Viti Levu, which is to the south west of Vanua Levu.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanua Levu, is expected to feel the brunt of Cyclone Daman about midnight. Our flight is scheduled ...</p><a href='default-id43.html'>(read more)</a><div style='clear:both;'></div><br /><h4>06/12/2007 - Slightly more hurried Fiji time</h4><div style='clear:both;'></div><p>We're not chilling as much anymore, as we were advised to leave our island in the Yasawas early and head back to the mainland as a result of cyclone Daman&nbsp;&nbsp;(see http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=75922)&nbsp;&nbsp;We're now spending a unplanned night in a rainy Nadi hoping that our evening flight tomorrow doesn't get canceled like all of the ones in the morning have!&nbsp;
