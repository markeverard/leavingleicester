        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Warm up the bus</h1><p><small>Entry added on 11/12/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Vancouver was chilly, so before we ventured out we raided Ian and Sarah's wardrobe to borrow all of their warm clothes which meant they were a little cold as we walked round Stanley park which overlooked the bay and downtown Vancouver.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The park was pretty and allowed great views over the surrounding area and harbour port freight terminal. Most surprising were the huge piles of bright yellow curry spice being offloaded from some of the massive oil tanker like ships. I never knew that these types of spices were mined and imported into countries. England, as far as I'm aware being a huge consumer of all thing spicy has a direct pipeline.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The park also had its own aquarium and rather than pay to go in we sneaked around the back and entertained the seals. Or rather, they entertained us.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Later in the day, we went to watch a Candian staple - Ice Hockey. It wasn't an NHL match (as thats super mega expensive) but ratherthe city's feeder club, the Vancouver giants. Bart said that she quite enjoyed it but she didn't understand all of the rules like fighting, power plays and power balls.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After the gme we were all tired and cold so we warmed up the bus and went home. </p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=82602&l=5540d&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=82602&l=5540d&id=700485318</a>
