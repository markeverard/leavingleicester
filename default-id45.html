        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Diving at Manta Ray</h1><p><small>Entry added on 06/12/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>I've just written a massive entry about this but then when I uploaded the pics it disappeared :( So..here's an abbreviated version.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I went diving on the 3rd day at Manta ray and it was awesome. The main guy took me out and we walked straight into the sea from the beach and began the dive from there.  It was so cool to be just the two of us cos he got to show me loads of stuff and I got to hold wierd things like sea pineapples, starfish and even got to touch some coral (usually you're not allowed as you can kill it but i guess this type was pretty robust). We saw loads of different types of coral & lots of colours...red/blue/yellow/jade..We also saw lots of fish and a moray eel poking out of soem coral which was a bit freasky.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The best bit was when we spotted 2 clown fish...they were so cute...and even better..they were hoverign over a gap in the coral and when we looked closer we could see it was because they had their tiny baby clown fish in there! Soo cute! I would've loved to have taken more pics as I couldn't really tell what I was pointing it but I managed to get a few decent ones.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I tried to find the dive site again when I went snorkling with eV but didn't manage it. It can't have too far away from where we were but as I couldn't navigate very well underwater then it was just guess work.  eV manage to spot 2 more clown fish though (different type to the ones I saw when diving) and I spent ages trying to get piccies but it's harder when you're snorkling cos you get buffeted out of position by the waves.  <br>&nbsp;We also got to see a manta ray...there are loads of them around that area when it's the right season but as we were out of season we were quite lucky to see it. And we saw an octopus..we think. It looked like one but it was tiny...I imagined them to be bigger than that!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway...all in all a good fishy adventure!!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;BULA! </p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74663&l=09444&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=74663&l=09444&id=700485318</a>
