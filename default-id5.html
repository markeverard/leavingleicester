        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Cheap Hotels.....</h1><p><small>Entry added on 18/10/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>I like to think I'm a trusting person who is pretty world wise, and so because of this I bring to you my guide to cheap hotels in Singapore.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;1) Travelling on a budget means that it is always wise to book your cheap hotels well in advance, preferably by the internet so you can check out any reviews. I booked our Singapore 1-star accommodation a few weeks back. At 30 pounds a night it seemed too good to be true<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;2) When arriving at the hotel check out the local area. In our case it seemed lively enough. Plenty of authentic bars filled with locals, both men and women. Plenty of people stood out on the street smoking (although mainly women). As I said to Ann-Marie they must be waiting for a taxi.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3) Always check out the rates your hotel offers. I thought I'd booked the cheapest rate, but our hotel offered a cheaper alternative, for people not wishing to stay the whole night, but by the hour. I mentioned to Ann-Marie that maybe we could have saved a few valuable pounds this way.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;4) Don't complain if your hotel has a few mssing fittings and features. Who needs to have more than one light bulb in a room and also whats the point of a duvet and sheets. Its Singapore. The place is boiling.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;5) Check out the local businesses. There seemed to be plenty of local opportunities for us to relax with an all over body massage, only 36 dollar.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;6) Make sure the hotel has a lively atmosphere. Our hotel certainly did, plenty of people coming and going all through the night. The ladies were dressed in their sunday best's (v. skimpy with high heeled shoes) whilst the men..... well as I mentioned to Ann-Marie 'the ladies were way too good for them'.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Its probably dawned on you all by now, but it took us about a day and a half. I always said I'd treat Ann-Marie to an unforgettable holiday. I've made a great start!!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p>
