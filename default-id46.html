        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Still Fiji time</h1><p><small>Entry added on 07/12/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Well we avoided the cyclone but we're still in Fiji.....<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It was all going so smoothly last night, no sign of rain or wind as we arrived at Nadi airport, although a heap of flights had been cancelled earlier in the day. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The flight boarded only 20 minutes late. We took off, had food, got to sleep, slept and dreamt well only yo be woken by the 'cabin crew prepare for landing' announcement. Sweet, we'd managed to sleep for the whole 6 hours of the first leg of the flight to Honolulu.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Or so we thought....<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;When Bart checked the time we'd only been flying for 4 hours, and there really aren't many (any) places to land between Fiji and Hawaii. Yep as we landed I wondered what the letters NADI stood for on the airport terminal. Yep we ended up back where we started 4 hours after taking off due 'a problem' with the aircraft.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We sat on the plane for 15 minutes, then were deboarded into the airport lounge where we stayed for an hour, only to be told we were to pass back into Fiji and be put up for the night again. So officially now we've been to Fiji twice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Our flight was rescheduled for 6pm the following day (today)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After a sleep, we had good news at lunchtime, when we were told to check out as our flight was due to leave at 3pm.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On arrival at Nadi airport it soon became apparent that there wasn't actually a flight and chaos ensued. We've ended up being rerouted so we now fly to LA at 11pm tonight (we missed the 3pm flight by 2 people) then we get a connection onto Vancouver arriving pretty much 24 hours after we should have done (fingers crossed).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We're now being put up in a different hotel for a few hours before the flight, which incidently is the same hotel we booked ourselves into after we got kicked off the islands due to the cyclone.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Somebody somewhere doesn't want us to leave Fiji.........</p></p>
