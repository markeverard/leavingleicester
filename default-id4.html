        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Rucksack BIA</h1><p><small>Entry added on 18/10/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>The rucksack has been found! It feels so nice to have fresh clothes :) It turned up at our hotel last night!! I've just checked it in again at Singapore airport so fingers crossed it makes it to Brisbane with me<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Quick update about yesterday...bit of a late start (1pm!) as it was quite hard to sleep in our noisy hotel...more on that later.&nbsp;Anyway after going to the airport to investigate my bag situation again (no joy) we went to Raffles Place and wandered around the Marina area and visited the Merlion. Next we headed to Gluttons' Bay...what a place :D Lots of cool food from various venders...we opted for some hot soup with a little furnace plus a seafood/meat platter thing that we cooked on our own table-top BBQ..very yummy. (Note to self...no one cares about what you ate, it's just you). Anyway we went to the Esplanade centre and watched some traditional Cambodian dancing-monkey, demon & two ladies..good stuff.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We then went to Raffles hotel which was every bit as posh as I imagined. We had Singapore Slings (naturally) at the gazebo bar which was really nice...(although a bit disappointing that they weren't made to order...especially at 50dollars for 2!).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We had a bit of a wander around Clarke key which had some very trendy bars/restaurants-in fact they were probably a bit too swanky for me in my 3day old clothes :)  In any case, we found a nice microbrewery and watched the England match.  The whole area was amazing at night when it was all lit up. We don't have too many pics though as we forgot to charge the camera.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Today we went to the Chinese Gardens...we weren't even sure if there were any gardens at the 'Chinese Garden' tube stop...it could've been an 'Elephant & Castle' type situation!!  Luckily though there were indeed some fabulous gardens (Chinese & Japanese). We wandered though them and saw a dragon/lizard type creature. Tried to take photos but it ran away...what sort of scaredy-cat dragon is that?  We had great fun on the little play area though and it was a very relaxing afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Next stop Brisbane....hope the blood doesn't rush to my head!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Catch you all down under :D<br>&nbsp;</p></p>
