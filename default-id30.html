        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Franz Josef Glacier</h1><p><small>Entry added on 17/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>After waking up in the layby we packed up and headed down the coast to the Franz Josef Glacier! <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A bit of blurb 'The Glacier descends deep into the lush rainforest of Westlandâ€™s National Park, from a height of 2700m above sea level to only 240m in as little as 11 km, making it the world's steepest and fastest flowing guided glacier.'  Franz Josef is one of only three temperate glaciers in the world (two of these are in NZ, the other in Argentina) so we definitely wanted to explore.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We were too late to get onto the half day guided walks around the base of the glacier so instead we splashed out on a heli-hike (our budget has been well and truly blown!: this involved a helicopter ride to the upper reaches of the glacier and then a 2hr guided walk across the glacier and a few ice caves along the way!  The helicopter ride was cool but it went so fast! Great views though!  It was a bit scary when he was coming in to land as we couldn't see anything to land on......the actual pad was tiny!!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The guided walk was awesome. We got to wear crampons which make it impossible to slip or fall over. It was so easy...felt like Spiderman walking sideways across ice walls :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After the tour we went back in our helicopter and as we were the last people of the day, our guide got the pilot to go closer to the mountain to see some mountain deer type creatures (with their cute babies!)that he'd spotted earlier. That was pretty nifty :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So, after this adventure we headed further south in our lovely camper-van until we got to Wanaka (another 4hr drive)...and picked up some hitch-hikers on the way! They were really nice and very grateful for the ride! It was eV's idea....I've heard the horror stories and seen 'The Hitchhiker' so if I'd have been in the driver's seat then I think I'd have put my foot down ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anyway...we made it without any problems and then this morning we took them the rest of the way to Queenstown with us!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Now, Queenstown...what a place!!!!............<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69962&l=3b9cb&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69962&l=3b9cb&id=700485318</a>
