        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Dolphin Encounter</h1><p><small>Entry added on 15/11/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Woo-hoooooooooooooooo! eV and I have just been swimming with dolphins & it was awesome! They were so close and there was loads of them. At one point I had about 5 of them swimming underneath me and showing off!...they got so close and if you hold their attention they play with you and go round you in circles and as you try to copy and rotate with them they change directions, so basically you look like floundering fools but it was cool!  <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I was making tooting noises which eV said scared him....he on the otherhand was singing barry manilow to them..lucky dolphins :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Pitty we cant find a cable to remove our snorkelling photos from the underwater camera as we would've got some awesome shots...instead you'll have to make do with the piccies we took from the boat :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Such good fun...would love to do it again!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69492&l=9a638&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69492&l=9a638&id=700485318</a>
