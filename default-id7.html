        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Whitsunday Island Sailing</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/10/2007 by Bart</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Tim:  I would have loved to have driven but I didn't take my license with me so I couldn't :( What a mistake-a to make-a)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;----<br>&nbsp;Big hello to everyone...sorry for the lack of updates...we've been out of touch with all things technological due to our tour thingies...<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;But anyway, just back from our sailing adventure which was amazing!! Amazing amazing amazing!!  eV is just downloading the photos now. I don't have long so just a quick update...we set sail in the Derwant Hunter...a nice tallship with big sails which looked cool!  On the first day we headed to Blue Pearl Bay for snorkelling and it was fab! Despite my fish phobia I got in the water and was loving it :)  There was an initial shock when I put my head in the water and there were about a dozen fish only inches away but I soon got used to it & it was great. At one point though I popped out of the water and when I tried to pop my head back in there was no room for it...the whole area was covered in fish.  <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The next day we went to Whitehaven Beach. Everyone we'd met on our travels said it was breathtaking...it didn't disappoint. The most beautiful place I've ever been. It was bliss.  Before that we did a mini bushwalk to a lookout point and our guide showed us a green ant nest in the trees. He also said if you lick their bums they taste of limes. I thought he was telling pork pies but it's true. Ev and I both had a go..quite an experience!! Later that day we did some more snorkling and took more pictures. We snokelled again today for the last time.  Saw a stingray and some turtles....even saw a dolphin from the boat :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We're getting the overnight bus in about an hour...the 10hour journey to Cairns.....hoping to do a scuba dive there which should be really good..so long as we don't see any sharkies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Stay tuned for the next update..<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=64747&l=a085d&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=64747&l=a085d&id=700485318</a>
