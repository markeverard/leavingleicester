        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Rafting - white</h1><p><small>Entry added on 29/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>Rotorua AKA Roto-vegas, the home of more crazy extreme activities. This time Bart and I decided we would partake in Rafting of the white water kind and also zorbing - (which for those of you not in the know is pretending to be a hamster and climbing in a big ball and rolling yourself down a hill).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I also unwittingly took part in the most extreme of all activities, one that produced a multitude of contrasting emotions. I call this activity losing the rental car keys.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The day started with a gentle raft along the grade 5 Kaituna river and over the highest commercially rafted waterfall in the world (7 metres). It all seemed fairly straightforward until we looked at the photos! Have a look to see what I mean! Anyway we survived and headed back to the hostel in order to refuel with a warrior breakfast. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We headed out to become zorb-anauts in the afternoon. We had to 'travel like commoners' and take the bus whilst the rental car stayed at the hostel. (note: by this time we'd located the car keys back at the rafting base but had to wait for them to be dropped off to us).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Zorbing is as stupid as it looks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72997&l=4c777&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72997&l=4c777&id=700485318</a>
