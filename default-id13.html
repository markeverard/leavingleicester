        <h1>Back in Blighty</h1><p>That's it we're back home after our amazing two month whistlestop tour of Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Canada. I've written the last blog and uploaded the last photo. I hope that you've enjoyed at least some of it. We're both now settling into, and sussing out our new lives in London (Ann-Marie starts her new job tomorrow). Keep in touch and if you're ever in the big smoke then give us a shout, its not a big place so we'll probably hear you.</p><h3>eV &amp; Bart</h3><hr /><h1>Everywhere you go... (eV)</h1><p><small>Entry added on 05/11/2007 by eV</small></p><div style='clear:both;'></div><p><p>This is the story of our 3 day camping adventure to Uluru and Kings canyon as told by me!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;--<br>&nbsp;The majority of the 3 days were spent driving. I reckon we did about 1500 km in total (About 1000 miles for those of you unwilling to understand metric), so it was lucky that we had an air-conditioned bus and had also stocked up on sunblock, as don't forget Uluru (Ayers Rock) is in the middle of the harsh unforgiving Great Australian Desert. I can certainly tell you that it is harsh and unforgiving........ Yep it pissed it down for pretty much the whole time we were out there. We visited Australia's driest region during some of their worst storms in recent memory and their first rain since March. As the Aussies tour guides and fellow tourists correctly told us - 'the bloody poms brought the rain with em!' and how!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Still, I think I may have preferred the rain to the scorching heat (Ann-Marie thinks differently hence her separate post on the same subject). Not many people get to see waterfalls on Uluru, rainbows over Kata Tjuta and lightning across the top of Kings Canyon. We can tick all three of those boxes. Unfortunately we can also tick the: bloody freezing as we took no warm clothes box,  the having to camp with no electricity box, and the running out of dry clothes box as well. Still you have to take the rough with the smooth, and it all turned out right in the end! (I'm still trying to convince Ann-Marie of these undeniable facts)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I can also see that Ann-Marie (who is on a computer next to me) is busy writing an exhaustive account of the things we actually did during the trip which leaves me with nothing much else to say, apart from; take a look at the photos linked from both posts.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Over and out<br>&nbsp;</p></p><hr /><h4>Photos:</h4><a target='_top' href='http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66761&l=936ca&id=700485318'>http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=66761&l=936ca&id=700485318</a>
